### Biopython: Tools for Bioinformatics
This repository contains examples that are prepared to illustrate the uses of the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) package for simple bioinformatics related tasks. We have benefited from [Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook](https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html), which includes extensive information and examples about the uses of the packages in Biopython. Some of the examples are collected from other Biopython related tutorials, original sources are provided inside the notebooks for these examples. Examples include the following:
1. **[Sequence Processing](https://github.com/efekankavalci/cmpe549-tool-presentation-examples/tree/main/sequence-processing)** 
2. **[Pairwise Alignment](https://github.com/efekankavalci/cmpe549-tool-presentation-examples/tree/main/pairwise-alignment)**
3. **[Accessing NCBI Databases (Entrez)](https://github.com/efekankavalci/cmpe549-tool-presentation-examples/tree/main/ncbi-access)**
4. **[Using ClustalW with Biopython](https://github.com/efekankavalci/cmpe549-tool-presentation-examples/tree/main/alignment-tools-clustalw)**
5. **[Phylogenetic Tree Construction](https://github.com/efekankavalci/cmpe549-tool-presentation-examples/tree/main/phylogenetic-tree-construction)**
6. **[Structural Analysis with PDB Module](https://github.com/efekankavalci/cmpe549-tool-presentation-examples/tree/main/structural-analysis)**
